ðŸ’¡**Highlight**:

1. TEMA for Enhancing Low-Resource Language Models: The Token Embedding Mapping Algorithm (TEMA) is the central proposal aimed at improving the quality of language models for low-resource languages. It maps the token embeddings from a richly pre-trained model (L1) to a poorly pre-trained model (L2), resulting in a richer and more accurate L2 modelâ€‹.

2. Competitive Results and Reduced Perplexity: Experiments show that the L2 model enhanced with TEMA reduces perplexity and achieves state-of-the-art results on semantic tasks such as SuperGLUE, outperforming other approaches like multilingual models or traditional transfer learning techniquesâ€‹.

3. Significant Impact on Languages with Complex Morphologies: TEMA was evaluated using Quechua, a low-resource language with complex morphology. The results demonstrated that TEMA substantially improves the semantic representation of tokens and accuracy in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition, compared to other methodsâ€‹.
